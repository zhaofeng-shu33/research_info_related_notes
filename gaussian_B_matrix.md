We investigate $||B||_F^2$ for two Gaussian random variables: $X$ and $Y$. We denote their coefficient as $\epsilon$, which is a very small.

There are two methods to compute this quantity. One is using direct integration.

Since 

$$
P_{XY}(x,y) = P_X(x)P_Y(y) + \epsilon P_X(x)P_Y(y) \phi(x,y)
$$

and $\widetilde{B}(x,y) = \phi(x,y) \epsilon$.
