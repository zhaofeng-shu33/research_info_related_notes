### Graph embedding and community detection

We consider a graph embedding function $f(G)$ and graph label $Y$.

By using data clustering techniques (for example k-means clustering) we can get an estimator $\hat{Y}$ from $f(G)$.

Spectral clustering is such a two-stage method.

Our goal is to find the embedding function which can make the exact recovery possible.

$f: G \to X_{n \times k}$
