A satisfied correlation metric is required to satisfy
the property that the two random variables are independent when the metric is zero and one is
determined by another when the metric is one.
The task to obtain such correlation metric is conducted
as a variational problem and can be transformed to solve
the smallest eigenvalue of a homogeneous Fredholm integral equation. By examining theses variational
problems we can obtain its relationship with the commonly used correlation metric and the curve fitting.

\section{Problem formulation and commonly-used correlation metric}
One of the notable view for the judgement of two-dimensional probabilistic distribution $w(x,y)$ is by fixing one variable $x$, the distribution of $y$ is more or less influenced or not. As is well known,
Such influence does not exist when $w(x,y)$
is the product of a function $w_1(x)$ of $x$ and
a function $w_2(y)$ of $y$. $x$ and $y$
are mutually independent in such case. On the
other hand, it can happen that for each given $x$
only a single $y$ is corresponded. Then $y$
is a function of $x$ and we say a complete correlation
exists between the two variables. In general the result lies between the two extreme cases, and there is a question about a metric for the tightness of the relationship
between $x$ and $y$. This is the correlation problem of statistics.

To characterize the correlation between $y$ and $x$,
there are many well-known different metrics, which we firstly quote here. Especially we observe a so-called
geometric probabilistic distribution for the random variable $x$ and $y$. Such pair is determined by the
positive function $w(x,y)$ by the normalization condition:
\begin{equation}
    \iint w(x,y) dx dy = 1
\end{equation}
Integrating by $x$ or $y$ we can obtain
\begin{equation}
    w_1(x) = \int w(x,y)dy \textrm{ and }
    w_2(y) = \int w(x,y)dx
\end{equation}
Their integral about $x$ or $y$ is 1. In the following we use $a$
and $b$ to describe the mean value of $x$ and $y$
with respect to the distribution $w(x,y)$.
This is the center or mass coordinate of the mass
density on the $xy$-plane. It is
\begin{align}
    a = \iint x w(x,y) dx dy = \int x w_1(x)dx \notag \\
    a = \iint y w(x,y) dx dy = \int y w_2(y)dy 
\end{align}
